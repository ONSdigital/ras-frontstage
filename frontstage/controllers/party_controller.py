      - Get all survey enrolments for the respondent

          - Get the business details the enrolment is for
          - Get the live-but-not-ended collection exercises for the survey the enrolment is for
          - Get the cases the business is part of, from the list of collection exercises. Note, this isn't every case

            subset of them.
          - For each case in this list:
              - Create an entry in the returned list for each of these cases as the respondent is implicitly part
                of the case by being enrolled for the survey with that business.
