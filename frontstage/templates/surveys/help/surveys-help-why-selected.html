<h1 class="u-fs-xl">Why was my business selected?</h1>
<p>We select businesses from the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR). The IDBR is a register of businesses in the UK registered for PAYE, VAT or with Companies House.</p>
<p>Selection depends on several factors. For example, the number of people employed, how many other businesses are operating in the same industry and the size of those businesses.</p>
<p>We always include large businesses in the survey sample because the information they provide can be significant.</p>
<p>Large businesses are usually defined as having over 100 employees.</p>
